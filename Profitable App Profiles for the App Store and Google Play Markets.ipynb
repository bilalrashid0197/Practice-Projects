I presumed that making an application for the Books and References genre/category in both the App Store and the Google Play store could be beneficial for the two stores. It appears as the applications under the Books and References type are very little and are not profoundly populated showing that there is space for development. One thing to note is that while making the application, our application ought to have something one of a kind, something that other applications don't have, for instance, every day quotes, tests, and a part for book reviews where individuals could voice their opinions."
